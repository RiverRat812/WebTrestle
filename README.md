The WebTrestle project is about building a simple bridge between the land of hardware and the internet. Currently, if you want to have a microcontroller upload data to the internet, you need to build a web application, define messaging prototocols, setup your hardware each time you start a new project.  In a few lines of code on an Arduino, you can generate a dynamic webpage for displaying data. Future versions will allow for control of hardware from the website as well.
